The provided C++ code implements an array reversal algorithm. Below is an explanation and analysis of the code:
Code Overview:
Reverse Function:
This function reverses the elements of the array using a two-pointer approach:

start points to the beginning of the array.
end points to the last element.
The swap function exchanges the values at these two indices, and the pointers are moved inward.
This continues until start is greater than or equal to end.
Print Array Function:
This function iterates through the array and prints each element, separated by spaces.

Main Function:

Takes user input for the number of elements (n) and the array elements.
Calls the reverse function to reverse the array.
Calls the printArray function to display the reversed array.

Analysis:
Efficiency:

The reversal function runs in 𝑂(𝑛) time, where 𝑛 is the size of the array.
The space complexity is 𝑂(1), as the reversal is done in place.
Edge Cases:

If n is 0, no elements are processed, and the program gracefully handles the case.
For a single element, the array remains unchanged.
Limitations:

The array size is fixed at 20, but the program does not handle cases where n > 20.
If the user enters fewer than n elements, the behavior is undefined (may lead to garbage values or unexpected behavior).
